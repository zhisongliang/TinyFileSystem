/* This function opens a regular UNIX file and designates the first nBytes of it as space for the emulated disk. nBytes should be a number that is evenly divisible by the block size. If nBytes > 0 and there is already a file by the given filename, that disk is resized to nBytes, and that file’s contents may be overwritten. If nBytes is 0, an existing disk is opened, and should not be overwritten. There is no requirement to maintain integrity of any content beyond nBytes. Errors must be returned for any other failures, as defined by your own error code system.  */

The bNum is a logical block number, which must be translated into a byte offset within the disk. The translation from logical to physical block is straightforward: bNum=0 is the very first byte of the file. bNum=1 is BLOCKSIZE bytes into the disk, bNum=n is n*BLOCKSIZE bytes into the disk. On success, it returns 0. Errors must be returned if ‘disk’ is not available (i.e. hasn’t been opened) or for any other failures, as defined by your own error code system. */
