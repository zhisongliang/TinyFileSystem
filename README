Deliverables
Record a short video (fewer than 5 minutes) demonstrating your file system (using your demo program described above). All members should discuss some of the design decisions you made, limitations of the system, as well as demonstrating the additional features you implemented. Be sure to give your names at the start of the video and please use the video submission link on Canvas (as opposed to including it with the code).



Names of all partners
An explanation of how well your TinyFS implementation works
